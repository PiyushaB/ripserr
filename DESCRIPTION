Description: The `ripserr` R package provides an R wrapper for Ulrich Bauer's
    C++ Ripser library for calculating Vietoris-Rips persistent homology. When
    integrated with R using Rcpp, `ripserr` can be used seamlessly with
    complementary R packages, such as `TDA`, for topological data analysis
    projects.
